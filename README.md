# krypta
Generating random bits, passwords, recovery phrases and Bitcoin private keys / addresses (including QR codes) from text seed and salt. Deliberately implemented in single file pure LuaJIT (including crypto routines and hashing functions) without any external dependencies. This is useful for generating passwords / private keys etc for the most important stuff you have. This software is ugly, not user friendly and not meant for computer illiterate.

Run without arguments to see the basic explanation of options.
