# krypta
Generating random bits, passwords, recovery phrases and Bitcoin private keys / addresses from text seed and salt. Deliberately implemented in single file pure LuaJIT (including crypto routines and hashing functions) without any external dependencies. This is useful for generating passwords / private keys etc for the most important stuff you have. This software is ugly, not user friendly and not meant for computer illiterate.
